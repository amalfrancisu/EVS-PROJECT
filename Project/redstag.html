                            <p id="opener" class="mar-l">The Kashmiri Red Stag is the only Asiatic survivor of the red deer group in the Indian subcontinent. The Hangul is considered as important to the region of Kashmir as the tiger is to the whole of India. King Hari Singh, the last king of Jammu & Kashmir was so fascinated by the animal that he had even constructed a rest house at lower Dachigam just for a glimpse of the Kashmir stag. Hangul is the state animal of Jammu and Kashmir of India.</p>

                            <p>The Kashmiri Stag, also called hangul, is a subspecies of elk native to India. This deer has a light rump patch without including the tail. Its coat colour is brown with a speckling to the hairs. The white rump patch does not extend much above the tail and is divided by a broad median stripe extending down to the base of the tail and sometimes to its extremity. The hair at the lower neck is long and shaggy with varying colors like brown or brownish ash or dark liver.</p>
                            <p>Known for its magnificent antlers with 11 to 16 points, hangul was once distributed widely in the mountains of Kashmir.Each antler consists of five tines. The beam is strongly curved inward, while the brow and bez tines are usually close together and above the burr. During early ‘90s, their number was believed to be about 3,000-5,000. Kashmiri Stags usually live in groups. The male deer battle with their antlers to control a herd that consists of female deer and their young. The herd is lead by the dominant stag. Hangul are active during the day when they are seen grazing along the slopes of the Dachigam wildlife sanctuary. The herd huddles together in a group at night, for warmth and for protection against predators.</p>
                            <p>Kashmir stag is a herbivores animal, they feeds on flowers, leaves, and tender shoots of shrubs.</p>

                            <p class="impose">The color of the Hangul’s coat is a brownish red, which is why it is also called Red Deer, however this color can vary with the season and age of the Hangul. In summer, their fur looks brighter rather than during other seasons. The color fades during the summer but tones up with the denser winter coat, which in a big stag is a very dark or rufous brown.</p>

They live in groups of two to 18 individuals in dense riverine forests, high valleys, and mountains of the Kashmir valley and northern Chamba in Himachal Pradesh. In Kashmir, it's found in the Dachigam National Park (and its nearby areas at elevations of 3,035 meters), Rajparian Wildlife Sanctuary, Overa Aru, Sind Valley, and in the forests of Kishtwar & Bhaderwah.</p>

                          <p id="ppp">These deer once numbered from about 5,000 animals in the beginning of the 20th century. Unfortunately, they were threatened, due to habitat destruction, over-grazing by domestic livestock, and poaching. This dwindled to as low as 150 animals by 1970. However, the state of Jammu & Kashmir, along with the IUCN and the WWF prepared a project for the protection of these animals. It became known as Project Hangul. This brought great results and the population increased to over 340 by 1980.</p>
                            <p id="ppp">Frequent uncontrolled fires in the recent years may have adverse effects on hangul population, by removing escape cover.</p>
                            <p id="ppp"> Besides, habitat degradation, poaching and lack of connectivity between the relic populations and the main (Dachigam) population could be another reason for the overall decline of hangul population </p>
                            <p id="ppp">The animal is battling for its survival in its last bastion: they are now scattered within 141 sq.km of the Dachigam National Park located on foothills of Zabarwan range on the outskirts of Srinagar.</p>

                            <p>Wildlife conservation fund was founded in 2010 with the objective to save the wildlife and Wilderness in Jammu and Kashmir. The state of Jammu & Kashmir, along with the IUCN and the WWF prepared a project for the protection of these animals. It became known as Project Hangul. It proposes to undertake the conservation and protection of wildlife in Jammu and Kashmir starting with the conservation of hangul.
It aims to achieve this through community support, awareness and management of wildlife. It aims to change attitudes towards nature and promote harmony between the humans and wildlife.</p>
                            <p>Wildlife experts say that a strong political will, which can help putting total focus on the Hangul’s conservation, is still lacking though former chief ministers have given assurances about conservation of this flagship wildlife species. </p>
                            <p>There is a need to conduct research on management aspects and to develope an effective management programme for Dachigam National Park inorder to decrease the risk factors and also to organize awareness camps for people on conservation of Hangul.</p>
