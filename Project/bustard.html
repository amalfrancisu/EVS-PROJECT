                            <p id="opener" class="mar-l">The great Indian bustard (​Ardeotis nigriceps​) or Indian bustard
                                is a bustard found on the Indian subcontinent. The great Indian
                                bustard inhabits dry grasslands and scrublands on the Indian
                                subcontinent; its largest populations are found in the Indian state of
                                Rajasthan. When the "national bird" of India was under consideration,
                                the great Indian bustard was a proposed candidate (strongly
                                supported by the Indian ornithologist Salim Ali) but dropped in favor
                                of the Indian peafowl with at least one reason being the potential for
                                being misspelled</p>

                                its native range. The great Indian bustard stands at about 1 m (3.3 ft)
                                tall, having a somewhat long neck and quite long legs. The female as

                                The crown of the head is black and crested and is puffed up by

                            <p>Historically, the great Indian bustard was distributed throughout
                                Western India, spanning 11 states, as well as parts of Pakistan. Its
                                stronghold was once the Thar desert in the north-west and the
                                Deccan plateau of the peninsula. The bustard is critically endangered
                                in Pakistan primarily due to a lack of protection and rampant hunting.
                                A few birds were detected in a September 2013 survey of the
                                Cholistan Desert in Pakistan.
                                In India, the bird was historically found in Punjab, Haryana,
                                Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra
                                Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil
                                Nadu. Today the bustard is restricted to isolated pockets in Andhra
                                Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and
                                Rajasthan (shared with Pakistan) </p>
                            <p>Great Indian bustards make local movements but these are not
                                well understood although it is known that populations disperse after
                                the monsoons. Males are said to be solitary during the breeding
                                season but form small flocks in winter. Males may however distribute
                                themselves close together and like other bustards, they are believed
                                to use a mating system that has been termed as an "exploded or
                                dispersed lek". The male is polygamous </p>

                            <p id="ppp">In 1994 great Indian bustards were listed as an ​endangered
                                species​ on the ​International Union for Conservation of Nature’s
                                (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species​. By 2011, however, the
                                population decline was so severe that the IUCN reclassified the
                                species as critically endangered.
                                Today, this species has disappeared from 90% of its former
                                range, leaving fewer than 300 birds, mainly confined to the Thar
                                Desert, Rajasthan. Historically, its decline was set in motion by
                                widespread hunting for food and sport. The biggest threat to this
                                species is hunting, which is still prevalent in Pakistan. This is followed
                                by occasional poaching outside Protected Areas, collisions with high
                                tension electric wires, fast-moving vehicles, and free-ranging dogs in
                                villages. Today, its woes are compounded by habitat loss due to
                                urbanization and the expansion of agriculture. </p>

                            <p id="ppp">With humans come
                                domestic animals: stray dogs are currently one of the biggest risks to
                                both adult birds and the single egg they lay each year. Offspring also
                                risk being trampled by livestock, despite the female’s heroic habit of
                                carrying her chick away under her wing when threatened.
                                One of the biggest dangers, however, are energy structures such as
                                wind turbines and power lines. Needless to say, renewable energy is
                                key to saving the planet – but when badly-planned constructions
                                obstruct habitats or migration routes, they pose a huge collision
                                hazard to this far-from-nimble flyer. The proposed expansion of
                                renewable energy infrastructure, which may involve deploying solar
                                panels over large areas of desert and grasslands is another threat to
                                the bird's habitat</p>

                                Kutch Bustard Sanctuary of Naliya in Kutch,​]​ Karera Wildlife
                                Sanctuary in Shivpuri district; Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary near
                                Nannaj, 18 km from Solapur in Maharashtra, Shrigonda taluka in
                                Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, near Nagpur and near Warora in
                                Chandrapur district in Maharashtra and Rollapadu Wildlife Sanctuary,
                                45 km from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh.
                                The rapid reduction of the population of India's bustards, their
                                endangered status and the decline of grasslands led the Ministry of
                                Environment and Forests to prepare species recovery programs in
                                2012 for three species of bustard; the great Indian bustard, the
                                Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) and the lesser florican
                                (Sypheotides indicus). These programs remain to be finalized and
                                executed by the state wildlife departments. The state of Rajasthan
                                initiated "Project Great Indian Bustard", on World Environment Day
                                2013, identifying and fencing off bustard breeding grounds in existing
                                protected areas as well as provide secure breeding enclosures in
                                areas outside protected areas.

                            <p>WWF-India has provided inputs in developing the ‘Guidelines
                                for the State Action Plan for Resident Bustard Recovery Programme’.
                                It has played an important role in raising awareness about the
                                declining populations and highlighting the importance of implementing
                                a focused bustard conservation program at the national level.
                                WWF-India is undertaking initiatives towards conservation of Great
                                Indian Bustard in and around Desert National Park. In the near future,
                                WWF also plans to expand the work in Gujarat and is making efforts
                                to raise funds towards this</p>
                            <p>Bolstered by a set of major landmarks decided by the
                                Convention on Migratory Species​ this February. Here, the Great
                                Indian Bustard was added to Appendix I: the strictest level of
                                protection. ​BNHS​, our Indian Partner, is working with the
                                Wildlife Institute of India to satellite-track the species to
                                understand its movements. The Ministry of Environment, Forest
                                and Climate Change plans to declare all Great Indian Bustard
                                habitats conservation reserves, and bury power lines
                                underground in these areas</p>
