                            <p id="opener" class="mar-l">The snow leopard, also known as the ounce, belongs to the
                                family of large cats. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global
                                population is estimated to number less than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to
                                decline about 10% by 2040. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction
                                following infrastructural developments.For millennia, this magnificent cat was the king
                                of the mountains. The mountains were rich with their prey such as blue sheep, Argali
                                wild sheep, ibex, marmots, pikas and hares. Snow leopards are found in 12
                                countries—including China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, and
                                Mongolia—but their population is dropping.</p>

                            <p>The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in a cold, mountainous environment.
                                Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss. Its broad paws well distribute the
                                body weight for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase the grip
                                on steep and unstable surfaces; it also helps to minimize heat loss. Its long and
                                flexible tail helps to maintain balance in the rocky terrain. The tail is also very
                                thick due to fat storage, and is very thickly covered with fur, which allows the cat to
                                use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep</p>
                            <p>The snow leopard's fur is whitish to gray with black spots on head and neck, but larger
                                rosettes on the back, flanks and bushy tail. The belly is whitish. Its eyes are pale
                                green or grey in color. Its muzzle is short and its forehead domed. Its nasal cavities
                                are large. The fur is thick with hairs between 5 and 12 cm (2.0 and 4.7 in) long. Its
                                body is stocky, short-legged and slightly smaller than the other cats of the genus
                                Panthera</p>

                            <p class="impose">Snow leopards are the only big cats that call the cold deserts of Asia
                                home. These deserts are also known as the third pole because they contain ice fields
                                with the largest reserves of freshwater outside the northern and southern polar regions.
                                They are often called the “ghosts of the mountain” because they are so rarely seen and
                                spend most of their lives in solitude.
                                The fur on their stomachs is nearly five inches thick to help them survive in cold,
                                harsh mountain climates.
                                Believe it or not, snow leopards can’t roar. Instead, they growl, yowl, mew and prusten
                                (also called chuffing, a non-threatening vocalization made by blowing air through their
                                nose).
                                A WWF study recorded snow leopards living at the highest altitude ever documented for
                                big cats — 5,859 metres above sea level — about the same height as Canada’s highest
                                mountain.
                                Their thick, massive tails, which shield them from the harsh weather and help maintain
                                balance, are almost as long as their entire body.
                                They can prey on animals up to three times their own body weight.</p>

                            <p>The snow leopard is distributed in the high altitudes of the Himalayas in India, Nepal,
                                and Bhutan, and the Tibetan Plateau. In Mongolia, it is found in the Mongolian and Gobi
                                Altai Mountains and the Khangai Mountains. In Tibet, it is found up to the Altyn-Tagh in
                                the north.

                            </p>
                            <p>Potential snow leopard habitat in the Indian Himalayas is estimated at less than 90,000
                                km2 (35,000 sq mi) in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim,
                                and Arunachal Pradesh, of which about 34,000 km2 (13,000 sq mi) is considered good
                                habitat, and 14.4% is protected.

                                In summer, snow leopards usually live above the tree line on mountainous meadows and in
                                rocky regions at altitudes from 2,700 to 6,000 m (8,900 to 19,700 ft). In winter, they
                                come down into the forests to altitudes around 1,200 to 2,000 m (3,900 to 6,600 ft).
                                Snow leopards prefer rocky, broken terrain, and can travel without difficulty in snow up
                                to 85 cm (33 in) deep, although they prefer to use existing trails made by other
                                animals.</p>

                                undoubtedly threatened as average temperatures continue to rise. Warmer average
                                temperatures are leading to decreased glacier size and the snowpack is melting earlier
                                and more quickly each year.

                            <p id="ppp">Poaching: Snow leopards have beautiful fur that is especially valued in Central
                                Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. Their bones and body parts are also used in
                                traditional Asian medicine and they are captured for the pet trade in Central Asia.</p>

                            <p id="ppp">Loss of prey and habitat: The reasons are hunting of wild sheeps and goats,
                                excessive mining , overgrazing.Greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a shift of the
                                treeline in the Himalayas and a shrinking of the alpine zone, which may reduce snow
                                leopard habitat by 30%.</p>

                            <p>In 2013, government leaders and officials from all 12 countries encompassing the snow
                                leopard's range (Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,
                                Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) came together at the
                                Global Snow Leopard Forum (GSLF) initiated by the President Almazbek Atambayev of the
                                Kyrgyz Republic, and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under the
                                government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The meeting was held in Bishkek, the capital of the
                                Kyrgyz Republic, and all countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain
                                habitat it lives in need trans-boundary support to ensure a viable future for snow
                                leopard populations, as well as to safeguard their fragile environment.
                            </p>
                            <p> The event brought together many partners, including NGOs like the Snow Leopard
                                Conservancy, the Snow Leopard Trust, and the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union.
                                Also supporting the initiative were the Snow Leopard Network, the World Bank's Global
                                Tiger Initiative, the United Nations Development Programme, the World Wild Fund for
                                Nature, the United States Agency for International Development, and Global Environment
                                Facility</p>

                            <p>Out of these efforts was formed a cooperative support effort, the Global Snow Leopard and
                                Eco-system Protection Program (GSLEP). The GSLEP is a joint initiative of range country
                                governments, international agencies, civil society, and the private sector. Its goal is
                                to secure the long-term survival of the snow leopard in its natural ecosystem.

                                The goal of the GSLEP is for the 12 snow leopard range countries, with support from
                                conservation agencies, NGOs and others to work together to identify and secure at least
                                20 healthy populations of snow leopards across the cat's range by 2020, or "20 by 2020".
                                Many of these populations will cross international boundaries.

                                The three criteria that will secure healthy populations of snow leopards are populations
                                that represent at least 100 breeding age snow leopards, contain adequate and secure prey
                                populations and have connectivity to other snow leopard populations.

                                This is an interim goal for the years through to 2020. During the coming years,
                                agreement will be reached on the steps needed to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring
                                that healthy snow leopard populations remain the icon of the mountains of Asia for
                                generations to come.</p>
