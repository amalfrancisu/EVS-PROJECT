        <div  class="ans col-md-8" >
            <p class= "">A. The species’ status, i.e, the conservation status of a species is decided by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The IUCN Red List has explicit criteria and categories to classify the conservation status of a species, on the basis of their probability of extinction, into one of eight categories.</p>

        <div  class="ans col-md-8" >
            <p class= "">A. The IUCN Red List is a critical indicator of the health of the world’s biodiversity. Far more than a list of species and their status, it is a powerful tool to inform and catalyse action for biodiversity conservation and policy change, critical to protecting the natural resources we need to protect.</p>
