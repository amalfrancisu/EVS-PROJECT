                            <p id="opener" class="mar-l">The White-bellied Heron  is the second largest heron in the world, after the Goliath Heron, with adults standing at well over a metre tall.Much of this height is due to their long neck. This species is part of the bird family Arideidae, which includes herons, bitterns and egrets, and this family diverged from all other bird families 51.6 million years ago in the Paleogene Period!</p>

                            <p>The white-bellied heron is also known as the imperial heron or great white-bellied heron.This large heron is plain dark grey above with a long neck.</p>
                            <p>The crown is dark and there are no black stripes on the neck as in the grey heron. In breeding plumage, it has a greyish-white nape plume and elongated grey breast feathers with white centers.The bill is black, greenish near the base and tip and the face is greenish grey. The legs are blackish with scale-like texture on the tarsus. The usual call given when disturbed is a deep croak.
                            </p>
                            <p> It is distinguished from the Grey Heron by its large size, especially the large bill, and the lack of dark “shoulder” patch. It is distinguished from the other great herons in its grey neck and brownish back. The Goliath species, beyond the average size difference, is distinguished by its chestnut neck while the slightly smaller great-billed heron is solid grey necked with the underside of the wings all grey. The smaller Sumatran Heron has grey and uniformly grey under wings. It is distinguished from cranes in flight by flying with its neck crooked back, not outstretched. </p>

                            <p class="impose d-none d-lg-block">A large, imperious stone-gray heron, very locally distributed and extremely rare species, note the dark gray wings, pale throat patch, and white belly of the White-bellied Heron. On the ground it walks slowly, moving its neck slowly while looking from side to side. It shows strong black-and-white contrast on the underwing when in flight. The rump appears paler grey. Inhabiting waterside areas surrounded by mature broadleaf forests in foothill and mountainous areas, it particularly favors pristine mountain rivers and streams. Sadly, it is presently declining due to habitat degradation.

                            <p>The white-bellied heron is found in the wetlands of tropical and subtropical forests in the foothills of the eastern Himalayas of India and Myanmar. It also occurs in Bhutan's sub-tropical areas and was once found in Nepal. The Great White-bellied Heron is not known to migrate, but likely post breeding dispersal occurs especially from lower marshy sites during the rains.</p>
                            <p>It is mostly solitary and occurs in undisturbed riverside or wetland habitats.</p>
                            <p>Its recent known distribution is India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam), northeast Bangladesh, Bhutan. This range is a substantial reduction from what is suspected to have been its historic range, which however is poorly known. It appears to have extended from the southern foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal and India (Assam, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland) , south to Bhutan, northern Myanmar, and (based on recent information) apparently Bangladesh and it has been reported from the Sundarbans. As far as is known it no longer occurs in Nepal, south Myanmar, or Assam .</p>

                            <p id="ppp">The decline of the heron's population is projected to increase in the near future as a result of the loss and degradation of lowland forest and wetlands, and through direct exploitation and disturbance.</p>
                            <p id="ppp">As a bird of mature forests, its habitat has been under severe threat throughout its range for a century. Although historically nearly inaccessible, its wet forest habitat has been cleared through much of central Asia. As a species that probably has always been scarce, habitat destruction and lack of protection pose the primary threat to its continued existence. Forested habitat is being destroyed by slash and burn agriculture in Arunachal Pradesh. It nests in Namdapha National Park and occurs in other protected areas in the non-breeding season. Lowland wet lands of Brahmaputra are threatened by siltation, plant growth, and fishing. Large-scale habitat a ation of its prime habitat is occurring in Myanmar and Bhutan. The Bhutan nesting area is affected by rock mining operations.</p>
                            <p id="ppp">It is a species that apparently is adversely affected by human disturbance, as evidenced by its occurrence primarily in remote forests. Human traffic and movement of domestic animals cause disturbances in the forest. In addition, birds are likely at risk from hunting of all sorts. Local people kill birds at the nest, obtaining them using long bamboo poles. It is likely that hunting has been a principal cause of loss of individuals. Attacks on birds and their eggs by predators  have been another major cause in their reduction. Rising water levels force the nesting birds to search extensively for fish, leaving the eggs or chicks exposed to predators such as the crested serpent eagle.The pressure on the birds has further risen with the lack of scientific approach and scanty awareness among the local communities. Heron habitat could also be defragmented with pro developmental activities such as, hydropower generation and road creation.</p>

                            <p>Little is known of the biology of this heron. Its current distribution needs to be determined. Surveys need to be conducted in search of this species, and naturalists within its range should be encouraged to report all sightings. Nest sites need to be located (and positively identified), nesting and feeding habitat better defined, and whether the species migrates or disperses needs to be determined in order to locate important areas. A conservation plan is needed to guide conservation action once individuals and especially nests are found.</p>

                            <p>The Save Our Species (SOS) Organisation has come up with a project that will focus on conserving three key sites along the Assam-Bhutan border. It will secure these sites for species recovery by sensitizing and mobilizing local communities, training a cadre of 6 local 'heron guardians' and creating disturbance free zones through community participation and sanction. A local NGO partner will assist in identifying and training community groups and individuals. The project will also create a platform for information exchange between conservation groups working on the species in Bhutan and India.</p>

                            <p>Conserving the White-bellied Heron and its habitat will result in conservation of several other species of plants and animals in the forests patches where they roost and breed and the river courses which are an important source of water.
