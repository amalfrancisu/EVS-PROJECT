We may have seen many tigers in our life, but no two tigers have similar strip patterns. Every tiger on earth has a distinct striped pattern which makes them different from other tigers and makes it easy in counting them during tiger census.</p>
                            <p>Their color ranges from yellow to light orange, with stripes from dark brown to black. Some of the Bengal Tigers are white in color. The tail is orange in color with black rings. Unlike the other white tigers that have blue eyes, Bengal tigers have yellow irises. </p>

                            <p class="impose">The Bengal tiger is defined by three distinct mitochondrial nucleotide sites and 12 unique microsatellite alleles. The pattern of genetic variation in the Bengal tiger corresponds to the premise that it arrived in India approximately 12,000 years ago.This is consistent with the lack of tiger fossils from the Indian subcontinent prior to the late Pleistocene, and the absence of tigers from Sri Lanka, which was separated from the subcontinent by rising sea levels in the early Holocene.</p>

                            <p>Like most tigers, the Bengal subspecies prefers living in areas without excessive human populations nearby. Unfortunately, undisturbed habitats are few and far between in the range of this subspecies. Because of this, this subspecies’ populations are fragmented and far apart. Within their range, these tigers live in both tropical and dry forests, mangroves, grasslands, and more.</p>
                            <p>Bengal tigers live in small “islands” of livable habitat, surrounded by large patches of areas where no tigers can survive. Most of these populations live within wildlife refuges or sanctuary areas. There are various patches across India where tigers live, but large expanses of inhospitable areas separate them. These tigers also live in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>

                            <p id="ppp">Considered a “man-eater”, the tiger was long believed to be an enemy that must be killed. Firearms used for commercial tiger hunting, as well as poison bait aimed at protecting livestock, opened the way for a genuine carnage. It became the official policy to encourage the killing of tigers as rapidly as possible, rewards being paid for their destruction in many localities. The United Provinces supported large numbers of tigers in the submontane Terai region, where man-eating had been uncommon Tigers were also poached for the supposed medical benefits of their organs.</p>

                            <p>The illicit demand for bones and body parts from wild tigers for use in Traditional Chinese medicine is the reason for the unrelenting poaching pressure on tigers on the Indian subcontinent. For at least a thousand years, tiger bones have been an ingredient in traditional medicines that are prescribed as a muscle strengthener and treatment for rheumatism and body pain.</p>

                            <p>Following the revelation that only 1,411 Bengal tigers existed in the wild in India, down from 3,600 in 2003, the Indian government set up eight new tiger reserves.Because of dwindling tiger numbers, the Indian government has pledged US$153 million to further fund the Project Tiger initiative, set up a Tiger Protection Force to combat poachers, and fund the relocation of up to 200,000 villagers to minimise human-tiger interaction. Indian tiger scientists have called for use of technology in the conservation efforts.</p>
                            <p>In January 2008, the Government of India launched a dedicated anti-poaching force composed of experts from Indian police, forest officials and various other environmental agencies. Ranthambore National Park is often cited as a major success by Indian officials against poaching.</p>
                            <p>An area of special interest lies in the "Terai Arc Landscape" in the Himalayan foothills of northern India and southern Nepal, where 11 protected areas composed of dry forest foothills and tall-grass savannas harbour tigers in a 49,000 square kilometres (19,000 sq mi) landscape. The goals are to manage tigers as a single metapopulation, the dispersal of which between core refuges can help maintain genetic, demographic, and ecological integrity, and to ensure that species and habitat conservation becomes mainstreamed into the rural development agenda. In Nepal a community-based tourism model has been developed with a strong emphasis on sharing benefits with local people and on the regeneration of degraded forests. The approach has been successful in reducing poaching, restoring habitats, and creating a local constituency for conservation</p>
